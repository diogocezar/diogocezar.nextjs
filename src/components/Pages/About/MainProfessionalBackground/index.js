              I led the creation of the technological structure, implementing
              cross-functional teams to expedite the delivery of features
              aligned with the company's dynamic strategy. I developed and
              implemented processes, including onboarding new collaborators, the
              lifecycle of demands, and the Upstream Board structure.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              I established guidelines for code review, card scoring, and
              repository documentation standardization. I implemented processes
              such as Remote First, post-mortem analysis, expedites, and mob
              programming. I created a selection process for technical
              collaborators and adopted a centralized knowledge tool.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              I defined and oversaw rituals such as dailies, technical
              refinements, card division and scoring, plannings, retrospectives,
              and produtech. I set tools and development standards, including
              naming conventions, commits, branches, and API documentation.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              I created a guide for roles, responsibilities, and career paths,
              emphasizing technical skills, deliverables, human skills,
              leadership, and strategic impact. I supported the construction of
              consistent and scalable solutions, applying concepts of
              microservices and database segregation.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              I implemented a monitoring culture and applied tools to extract
              information from backend and frontend applications. I faced
              challenges such as organizing infrastructure, forming an
              integrations squad, and synchronizing database projects.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              I achieved significant deliveries, such as a 100% increase in

              organization, and processes. Leading a data team, I resolved
              technical debts and propelled deliveries.

              By the end of this leadership stint, we delivered a minimally
