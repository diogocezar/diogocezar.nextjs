            <Paragraph>
              In my journey as Head of Technology, I faced the challenge of
              creating a robust technological structure for a rapidly growing
              company. I identified the need for an integrated approach to
              feature delivery, and to address this, I implemented
              cross-functional teams. My plan involved developing efficient
              processes such as onboarding new collaborators, demand lifecycle,
              and structuring the Upstream Board.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              To ensure code quality and documentation standardization, I
              established guidelines for code review and task scoring. I
              introduced practices such as Remote First, post-mortem analysis,
              mob programming, and agile processes. Additionally, I created a
              selection process for technical collaborators and adopted a
              centralized knowledge tool, fostering a culture of continuous
              improvement.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              During execution, I defined and supervised essential rituals such
              as dailies, technical refinements, planning, retrospectives, and
              produtech. I standardized tools and development methods, including
              naming conventions, commits, branches, and API documentation.
              Furthermore, I developed a guide for roles, responsibilities, and
              career paths, focusing on technical skills, deliverables, human
              skills, leadership, and strategic impact.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              The results were remarkable, including a 100% increase in team
              performance and the resolution of technical debts. Leading a data
              team, I drove innovations, efficiency, and technical excellence,
              significantly contributing to the company’s success. I mentored
              various areas of Bankme in leadership, organization, and
              processes, ensuring the delivery of consistent and scalable
              solutions through concepts of microservices and database
              segregation.

              I stepped into the role of leading the Product team during a
              critical phase when our processes were undefined and demand
              management was chaotic. The team faced a lack of clarity in
              prioritizing tasks and achieving visibility on deliveries.
              Recognizing the urgency, I took the challenge head-on to establish
              a solid foundation.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              My plan was straightforward but ambitious: implement a new product
              process to streamline demand arrival, improve prioritization, and
              enhance visibility. I collaborated with the team to design this
              new process, ensuring every member’s input was valued.
              Additionally, I introduced Personal Development Plans (PDP) for
              each team member, fostering their growth and aligning their
              individual goals with our collective objectives.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              Execution was key. We meticulously rolled out the new process,
              addressing challenges as they arose and refining our approach
              based on feedback. The introduction of PDPs empowered team members
              to take ownership of their development, contributing to a more
              engaged and productive workforce.

              By the end of this leadership period, the transformation was

              vision, structured processes for demand collection,
              prioritization, and execution. The foundation we laid set the
              stage for continued growth and success.
