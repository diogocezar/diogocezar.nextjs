            <Paragraph>
              I faced the challenge of creating a robust technological structure
              for a rapidly growing company. I identified the need for an
              integrated approach to feature delivery, and to address this, I
              implemented cross-functional teams. My plan involved developing
              efficient processes such as onboarding new collaborators, demand
              lifecycle, and structuring the Upstream Board.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              To ensure code quality and documentation standardization, I
              established guidelines for code review and task scoring. I
              introduced practices such as Remote First, post-mortem analysis,
              mob programming, and agile processes. Additionally, I created a
              selection process for technical collaborators and adopted a
              centralized knowledge tool, fostering a culture of continuous
              improvement.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              During execution, I defined and supervised essential rituals such
              as dailies, technical refinements, planning, retrospectives, and
              produtech. I standardized tools and development methods, including
              naming conventions, commits, branches, and API documentation.
              Furthermore, I developed a guide for roles, responsibilities, and
              career paths, focusing on technical skills, deliverables, human
              skills, leadership, and strategic impact.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              The results were remarkable, including a 100% increase in team
              performance and the resolution of technical debts. Leading a data
              team, I drove innovations, efficiency, and technical excellence,
              significantly contributing to the company’s success. I mentored
              various areas of Bankme in leadership, organization, and
              processes, ensuring the delivery of consistent and scalable
              solutions through concepts of microservices and database
              segregation.

              I stepped into the role of leading the Product team during a
              critical phase when our processes were undefined and demand
              management was chaotic. The team faced a lack of clarity in
              prioritizing tasks and achieving visibility on deliveries.
              Recognizing the urgency, I took the challenge head-on to establish
              a solid foundation.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              My plan was straightforward but ambitious: implement a new product
              process to streamline demand arrival, improve prioritization, and
              enhance visibility. I collaborated with the team to design this
              new process, ensuring every member’s input was valued.
              Additionally, I introduced Personal Development Plans (PDP) for
              each team member, fostering their growth and aligning their
              individual goals with our collective objectives.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              We meticulously rolled out the new process, addressing challenges
              as they arose and refining our approach based on feedback. The
              introduction of PDPs empowered team members to take ownership of
              their development, contributing to a more engaged and productive
              workforce.

            <Paragraph>
              By the end of this leadership period, the transformation was
              evident. We had a minimally organized team with a clear roadmap
              vision, structured processes for demand collection,
              prioritization, and execution. The foundation we laid set the
              stage for continued growth and success.

              to overhaul existing processes and increase team productivity.
              Through strategic planning and execution, I introduced innovative
              frameworks that not only optimized operations but also fostered a
              culture of continuous improvement. Conducting insightful 1:1
              meetings, I identified team strengths and areas for development,

              burndown processes. This approach not only optimized project
              timelines but also ensured seamless collaboration across
              multifunctional teams. I played a pivotal role in steering
              critical projects, including the successful integration of the

              through the stabilization phase of this ambitious project.
              Post-launch, I assumed leadership roles within the Activation and
              Onboarding Squads, ensuring the continued success and optimization
              of the digital account platform.

              Throughout this experience, I honed invaluable skills in technical
              leadership, project management, and cross-functional
              collaboration, driving innovation and achieving tangible results
              that revolutionized financial services for micro-entrepreneurs in
              Brazil.

              Joining MEI Fácil at its inception, I embarked on a journey
              defined by innovation and impact in simplifying bureaucracy for
              micro-entrepreneurs (MEIs) across Brazil. As one of the pioneering
              members of the technology team, I played a pivotal role in shaping
              our approach to solving critical challenges faced by MEIs.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              At the core of MEI Fácil’s success were three pillars: Business
              Education, Bureaucracy, and Finance, which collectively
              transformed our platform into a pioneering super-app. My journey
              as a technical leader began here, where I not only built and led
              high-performing teams but also nurtured a technology-driven
              culture focused on continuous improvement and user-centric
              innovation.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              I spearheaded various projects, with a significant focus on the
              MEI Fácil Account, pivotal in our integration with Banco Neon.
              Through strategic planning and hands-on execution, we evolved our
              solutions to meet the evolving needs of MEIs, delivering tangible
              results that streamlined operations and empowered entrepreneurs
              nationwide.
