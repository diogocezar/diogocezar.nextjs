              I am one of the founders of Typper.io, a project born from the
              passion of four tech enthusiasts for entrepreneurship and AI.
              Typper evolved from the Figma plugin, and in no time, we’ve
              achieved remarkable growth and visibility. We’re dedicated to
              creating products that simplify tedious daily tasks, making Typper
              your personal typist to boost efficiency. Currently, Typper offers
              three products: FigmaAI - Texts, FigmaAI - Images, and Typper
              Codes.

              I led the creation of our tech structure, forming cross-functional
              teams to speed up feature delivery in line with our dynamic
              strategy. I developed and implemented processes for onboarding,
              demand lifecycle, and the Upstream Board structure. Guidelines for
              code review, card scoring, and documentation were standardized.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              I introduced processes like Remote First, post-mortem analysis,
              expedites, and mob programming, and created a selection process
              for technical collaborators. Centralized knowledge tools and
              defined rituals—dailies, technical refinements, planning,
              retrospectives, and produtech—were established.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              I set standards for development tools, naming conventions,
              commits, branches, and API documentation. I also created a roles
              and responsibilities guide, emphasizing technical skills,
              deliverables, human skills, leadership, and strategic impact. I
              supported scalable solutions with microservices and database
              segregation, and promoted a monitoring culture with backend and
              frontend tools.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              My efforts led to significant improvements, including a 100%
              increase in performance. I mentored other teams at Bankme in
              leadership and processes, resolved technical debts, and drove
              innovation, efficiency, and technical excellence, contributing to
              the company’s success.

              I briefly led the Product team, focusing on establishing a solid

              demand management, prioritization, and delivery visibility. We

              fostering collaboration on their growth.

              organization and productivity. I conducted 1:1 meetings to
              understand team strengths and areas for improvement, dedicating
              70% of my time to people and team management and 30% to execution.

              My time at Magalu was a deep dive into BigTech, honing my
              strategic vision, process refinement, and cutting-edge technology
              skills. It was a training ground for both my technical and
              leadership abilities. As a Tech Lead in the MagaluPay tribe, I
              supported several squads focused on growing Magalu’s fintech
              products.

              within MagaluPay, a project I’m particularly proud of.

              technical leader for the MEI Fácil app and its integration APIs
              with Banco Neon. I supported the teams during the stabilization
              period of this major project. Post-delivery, I served as the Tech

              MEI Fácil was born with a hands-on spirit! In a short period of
