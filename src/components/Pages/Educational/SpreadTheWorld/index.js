        The best way to learn is by teaching others. Throughout my journey, Iâ€™ve
        embraced this philosophy in many forms: as a teacher, speaker, and
        through video courses. The method doesnâ€™t matter, as long as youâ€™re
        helping someone. ðŸ˜‰

        This space is dedicated to cataloging and remembering my efforts to
        spread the knowledge of development. Youâ€™ll also find some downloadable
        content to explore.
