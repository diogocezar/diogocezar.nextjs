history1: Since 2003, when i started my studies at college, development and technology are part of my life. As student of UTFPR at Cornélio Procópio - Paraná - Brasil, i could develop (among many other things) an experimental adaptive hypermedia system based in any colony optimisation, to help users to find what they need on website.
history2: At that moment, I realised that academic environment could be a nice way for my professional life. In 2010 I started my master degree course at UFPR at Curitiba - Paraná - Brasil, where I finally understand the concept of a famous sentence, that sounds like “more you study, less you know”. At master degree, I developed an smart scheduling system using planning, to process big data volumes at distributed environment.
historyHL: In parallel with my academic carrier, could be involved with web development for many publicity agencies. Where I could develop projects for many Brasilian national artists.
history3: Nowadays, I work as senior developer, teacher and talker.
profession: Technological stuffs always been present in my life. Still remember my old 486, ant it causes me some nostalgia and worry, because I realize that im getting old. Always encouraged by my father, I have long been interested in understanding how things work. Although I have done several courses, I believe that there is an essential skill for professionals of technology scenarios: your need learn how to learn.
