        The better way to learn something is when you try to explain it to someone. In my journey I
        tried to do it in many ways. As teacher, as talker or with some video courses. Doesnâ€™t
        matter, since you try to help someone ;)
      </QuotedParagraph>
      <Paragraph font="sans-serif" bold={true}>
        So, here is a perfect place to index, and remember all my tries of spread the word of
        development. Also, you can see a little bit with downloadable content.
